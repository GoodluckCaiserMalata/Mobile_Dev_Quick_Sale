## Description
This is an online marketplace allowing users to buy, sell, or even exchange secondhand items (shoes, clothes, electronics e.t.c.) in the comfort of their respective homes.

## Why QuickSale?
Consumption has been part of humanityâ€™s lifestyle for decades, from simply buying home supplies/groceries to expensive items that will probably be used once in a while. On the other hand, humans have generated more than 200 million tons of solid waste over the years when it comes to the environment. Approximately 50% of those waste are unused items and still in good condition. However, disposing of them has substantial environmental impacts and causes severe problems in many aspects. For example, textiles can take up to 200+ years to decompose, while E-waste might take forever as electronic devices were made to resist decomposition.

## Purpose
- Reducing waste while maintaining the consumer culture, people should be able to sell/buy, or exchange unused goods at home.
- Letting users to gain some side-incomes during these hard times.
- Providing an eco-friendly application that aims for the benefit of the environment
